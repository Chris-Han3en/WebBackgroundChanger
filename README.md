# WebBackgroundChanger

hey, welcome to web background changer thing

# How it works

You enter in a string, it seperates the string if need be, it then makes a web client and seaches in google images for what you entered, it then find the first thing on the page with a <img> tag, it then finds the src in it and takes that data, it then removes the data:image part and converts it to a image where is is saved on your pc, it then finds where is is saved and sets it as your background

# Known problem

On some searches there are tags at the top for recommendations. As they have a <img> tag and a src they take the image from there and as its 100x100 its a tad bit streched/low res background. This can be fixed which i might do in the future but i am looking to do another project.
